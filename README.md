# BirthdayGreetingApp-
I made this android app using Android Studio. 
And Shrikant Sir my Department HOD is the inspiration to make me push this project on github. 
App is not that complex, no api calls nothing. Its just has 2 activities and one button and one toast message too.
I made this app to wish my firend's(BFF) b'day.
That's all about my First Android App.
